If you are new to Black Jack or need a refresher, feel free to review the rules before playing the game. Black Jack is a card game where the objective is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player is initially dealt two cards and can choose to draw additional cards (hit) or keep their current hand (stand). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) have a value of 10, while Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.
